# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project is the getting started tutorial on hardhat.org's website.

It is a great project for beginners as it really explains all the code you are writing. Highly recommend checking it out if you are just getting started with Solidity.

This project taught me how to create a contract and interact with it, but also how to test it. There are also standard practices taught with testing, which I found particularly valuable
